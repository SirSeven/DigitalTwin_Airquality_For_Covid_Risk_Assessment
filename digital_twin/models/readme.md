# Models

To provide a basis for discussion, we provide example models for three different maturity levels of the overall system using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and AutomationML.

## Baseline

In a baseline system, a Building consists of several Rooms. These rooms contain controllers, which are again connected to sensors (to get air quality data from the room) and alarms (to give notifications to the room). This setting is visualized below, and modeled in [Baseline.uml](./baseline.uml) and [Baseline.aml](./baseline.aml). We also provide example instantiations in [Baseline_Instances.uml](./baseline_instances.uml) and [Baseline.aml](./baseline.aml).
