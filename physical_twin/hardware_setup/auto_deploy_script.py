'''
This script was writen by Hari and Managed by Burcu for:
If you want to copy a file/dir from your computer to raspberry we can use this script as to copy the files to them:
also creates the device_name.txt file in the raspberry in /home/pi/ path to name the each device unique.

Data needed:
1. File/Dir to copy should be available in your computer (eg. Folder 'haridir')
2. Ip address, User ID and password of the raspberry
3. device_name (should be unique for among all raspberry

For adding new raspberry you can create new list as 'rasp##' as list below and its details it can automatically copy files to it
